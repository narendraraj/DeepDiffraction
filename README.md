# Deep Diffraction
A series of deep convolutional neural networks to automatically analyze position averaged convergent beam electron diffraction patterns (PACBEDs) for automatically processing big, 4D STEM data.
1) Auto-align raw PACBEDs without the need for pretreating the data. 
2) Measure the sample thickness and tilt.
3) Hybrid CNN + least square fitting (LSF) for more general PACBED analysis.
